# INTRODUCTION

In the World of Technology, Biometrics plays an effective role in identifying Human beings.Through this project, we will develop a unique system that can identify students for
attendance purpose using their fingerprints. In this project, we are going to design aFingerprint Sensor Based Biometric Attendance System using Atmega32.
Simply we will be interfacing fingerprint sensor with Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD Display & RTC Module to design thedesired project. In this project, we used the fingerprint Module and Atmega32 to take and keep
attendance data and records.By using the fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. A system that records the attendance making use of biometric scanners and stores them securelyover cloud in the form of Google Spreadsheet can help resolve issues. 
humans are more likely to trust machines over people, which is likely evident from us revealing our ATM pin to a machine so easily. Today, in the world where AI, Machine learning, Chat bots, Smart Speakers, Robots etc are actively progressing, this synergy between humans and robots is only set to increase. Today, from bridge toll collectors to check-out cashiers everything around us is being replaced by machines to get the work done easier and more efficient. To keep up with the phase, in this project we will build a Bio-metric Attendance system using AVR microcontrollers to replace the manual procedure of taking attendance. This system will be more reliable and efficient since it would save time and avoid dodgers.
