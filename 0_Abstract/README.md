# Fingerprint based biometric attendance system

ABSTRACT

In industrial and domestic applications attendance registering is important at each and every moment. Many face a lot of problems due to lack of proper attendance monitoring system. In
this project we use Fingerprint Sensor (R305) which senses the Fingerprint of a particular person; a buzzer and Led gets activated whenever a person places his finger on the sensor. 
This  project has a wide application inschool, college, business organization, offices where marking of attendance is required accurately with time. By using the fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. Biometric student attendance system increases the efficiency of the process of taking student 2 attendance.It will also prevent proxy attendance, thus increasing the
reliability of attendance records.Proper attendance recording and management has become important in todayâ€™s world as attendance and achievement go hand in hand. Attendance is
one of the work ethics valued by employers. Most of the educational institutions and government organizations in developing countries still use paper based attendance method for
maintaining the attendance records. There is a need to replace these traditional methods of attendance recording with biometric attendance system. The unique nature of fingerprint
makes it ideal for use in attendance management systems. Besides being secure, Fingerprint based attendance system will also be environment friendly. Fingerprint matching is widely
used in forensics for a long time. It can also be used in applications such as identity management and access control. This review incorporates the problems of attendance systems
presently in use, working of a typical fingerprint based attendance system, study of different systems, their advantages, disadvantages and comparison based upon important parameters
